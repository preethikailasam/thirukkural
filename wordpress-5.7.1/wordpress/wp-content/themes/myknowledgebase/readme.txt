== Description ==
MyKnowledgeBase is a lightweight and mobile-friendly WordPress theme. Personalize your website via the Customizer in your dashboard and by using a custom post or page template. With 2 of the custom page templates you can transform your categories and posts into a knowledge base, FAQ, wiki or link portal. It also contains multiple widget areas. Enjoy!


== Installation ==
1. Go to your admin Dashboard > Appearance > Themes.
2. Select and install a new theme from the online WordPress Theme Directory or from your pc (zip file).
3. Once activated, you're ready to use it.

= Set hompepage =
You can choose between the default homepage (displaying posts) and a static page as homepage.

To set a static page as homepage go to your admin Dashboard > Settings > Reading and select the page you want.

= Post and page templates =
While creating a post or page you can choose between default layout (with sidebar) and full width layout. This can be done via the Post or Page Attributes box.

= Customizer =
You can personalize your theme via the Customizer in your dashboard.

= Create a knowledge base =
The knowledge base uses the native categories and posts.

Create a new page and select the knowledge base page template. You can choose between 3 columns (with sidebar) and 4 columns (without sidebar).

There's also a field to exclude categories.

Settings for the knowledge base can be found in the Customizer.

Parent and subcategories are listed separately.

= Create a link portal =
To display a list of website links you can install this plugin: https://wordpress.org/plugins/page-links-to

While creating a post you can set a redirect to an URL (website) of your choice.

When you click the post link in the frontend of your website it will redirect you to this URL (so the post will not open).
